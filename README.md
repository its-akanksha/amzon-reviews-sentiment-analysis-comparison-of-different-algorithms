Comparison of different sentiment analysis algorithms

This repository contains web scraped data from official site of Amazon. The data is used to perform different sentiment analysis 
algorithms and calculate their precision, accuracy, f-score. This helps to compare between different algorithms for sentiment analysis 
and decide which one to use for a particular project. 

The algorithms performed are:
1. Logistic regression
2. Support vector classifier
3. Gaussian naive bayes
4. Decision tree classifier
5. K nearest neighbor classifier
6. Gradient Boosting Using Decision Tree as a Base Algorithm
7. Extra Gradient Boost Using Decision Tree as a Base Algorithm
8. Random Forest
9. Random Forest Classifier using AdaBoost and PCA
10. Bagging Classifier
11. Light Gradient Boosting
12. Cat Boost Classification
